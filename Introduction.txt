What is typescript ?

TypeSCript is a superset of javascript, that means any valid JS is a TS but not all TS is a JS 
TS have a additional feature than JS that  do not exist in current version of JS like, for Ex :- 

In TS we have concept call as Strong Typing/ Static Typing  
:- We don't need to specify type of a variable in JS while in TS we can specify the type of the variable like we 
do in C#, javascript


TS brings the features of object Oriented features to JS

Using TS we can catch most of the errors while complie time instead of catching run-time errors
